Code of Conflict
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Why
===

Simply put, the "Code of Conduct" was really just a power play to make Linux users and developers to abandon the platform. So, I am forking it.

What
====

This code of conflict here by states that all code shall be judged based on technological merit alone, not by the contributor's identity. In layman's terms, we don't care who you ware, we just care if you are a skilled programmer.

Attribution
===========

While the original Code of Conflict cannot be found (or at least, I cannot find it), I had to write this up myself. If you remember the original code of conflict, please put it here! If the Code of Conduct is found here, it will be replaced by this text.
